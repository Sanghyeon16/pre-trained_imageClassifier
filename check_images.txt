Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, the three models classified the breed of dog to pug 100%.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, event though the image is symmetry, three models classified it to same breed of dog.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes,three models configured that the two images are not dog. 


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: I think alexnet architecture is the best model among three classifiers. Alexnet is not only accurate but also fast. In accuracy aspect, alexnet and vgg classified frog image as tree frog but resnet didn't. It classified tree frog as tailed frog and toad. In the calculating time point of view, alexnet and resnet returned 0 seconds of runtime but vgg returned 3 seconds for it's runtime. So, in the production aspective alexnet is the best model among three pre-trained classifer architecture for this image classification task.
